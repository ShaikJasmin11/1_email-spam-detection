#  Email Spam Detection

>  RISE Internship Project 1 â€“ Tamizhan Skills  
>  Built with Scikit-Learn, Streamlit, and TfidfVectorizer

A machine learning-based web app that classifies emails as **spam** or **ham** using a trained Naive Bayes model. This is the first project from the **Machine Learning & AI** track of the RISE Internship by Tamizhan Skills.

---

##  Project Objective

To build a lightweight and accurate email spam classifier that:
- Cleans and processes raw text
- Uses TF-IDF for feature extraction
- Trains a Naive Bayes model to classify email messages
- Provides a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas / NumPy**
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**
- **Streamlit** (for UI)
- **Joblib** (to save models)

## Dataset

- Source: Kaggle â€“ SMS Spam Dataset
- Contains ~5,000 labeled emails (spam/ham)

---

## How to Run

- Step 1: Install Dependencies
  ``` bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Step 2: Train the Model
  ``` bash
  python main.py
  ```

- Step 3: Launch the Web App
  ``` bash
  streamlit run app.py
  ```

## Model Performance

âœ… Accuracy: ~92%

âœ… Fast inference (Naive Bayes)

âœ… Can be integrated with contact forms, email inboxes, or APIs

---

## Highlights

- Cleaned using custom regex and preprocessing
- TF-IDF vectorization for text encoding
- Streamlit interface with real-time spam prediction
- Production-ready structure with modular Python code
